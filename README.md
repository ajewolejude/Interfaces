# Interfaces
I wanted to tackle the concept of Interfaces from a different approach. In this project, there is a programming problem which is intended to demonstrate a perfect scenario for solving a problem by making an Interface.

Using Interfaces:
-you can avoid tight coupling of your code which reduces the dependencies of one class on another (foreinstance).
-it also helps to manage change requirements.

Bye!
